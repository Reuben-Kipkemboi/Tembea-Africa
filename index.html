            <p>
              Maasai Mara, also sometimes spelled Masai Mara and locally known
              simply as The Mara, is a large national game reserve in Narok,
              Kenya, contiguous with the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania. It
              is named in honor of the Maasai people, the ancestral inhabitants of
              the area, who migrated to the area from the Nile Basin. Their
              description of the area when looked at from afar: "Mara" means
              "spotted" in the local Maasai language, due to the many short bushy
              trees which dot the landscape. Maasai Mara is one of the most famous
              and important wildlife conservation and wilderness areas in Africa,
              world-renowned for its exceptional populations of lion, African
              leopard, cheetah and African bush elephant. It also hosts the Great
              Migration, which secured it as one of the Seven Natural Wonders of
              Africa, and as one of the ten Wonders of the World. The Greater Mara
              ecosystem encompasses areas known as the Maasai Mara National
              Reserve, the Mara Triangle, and several Maasai Conservancies,
              including Koiyaki, Lemek, Ol Chorro Oirowua, Mara North, Olkinyei,
              Siana, Maji Moto, Naikara, Ol Derkesi, Kerinkani, Oloirien, and
              Kimintet.

      <h3>Egypt.</h3>
      <hr>
        <p class="intro">Egypt, a country linking northeast Africa with the Middle East, dates to the time of the pharaohs. 
          Millennia-old monuments sit along the fertile Nile River Valley, including Giza's colossal Pyramids
           and Great Sphinx as well as Luxor's hieroglyph-lined Karnak Temple and Valley of the Kings tombs. 
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>The Pyramids of Giza</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="list">
          The most famous of the structures at Giza, near Cairo, the Pyramid of King Cheops was built around 2650 BC from 2.5 million blocks of limestone. Its sides are oriented exactly to the north, south, east and west.
          The Chephren pyramid, built by Cheops' son, is similar in size and incorporates the entrances to a burial chamber that still contains the large granite sarcophagus of King Chephren.
          The pyramid of Mycerinus is smaller than both and all three are surrounded by other smaller pyramids and dozens of tombs.

      <p class="islamic">
        The atmospheric, narrow lanes of the capital's Islamic Cairo district are crammed full of mosques, madrassas (Islamic schools of learning), and monuments dating from the Fatimid through to the Mameluke eras.

        This is where you'll find the labyrinth shopping souk of Khan el-Khalili, where coppersmiths and artisans still have their tiny workshops, and stalls are laden with ceramics, textiles, spice, and perfume.

        Surrounding the market is a muddle of roads, home to some of the most beautiful preserved architecture of the old Islamic empires.

        There is a wealth of history here to explore. Visit Al-Azhar Mosque and the dazzling Sultan Hassan Mosque, and make sure you climb to the roof of the ancient medieval gate of Bab Zuweila for the best minaret-speckled panoramas across the world.

        Famed for the Valley of the Kings, Karnak Temple, and the Memorial Temple of Hatshepsut, the Nile-side town of Luxor in Upper Egypt has a glut of tourist attractions.

        This is ancient Thebes, power base of the New Kingdom pharaohs, and home to more sights than most can see on one visit.

        While Luxor's East Bank holds the modern city, with its vibrant souq; the two temples of Karnak and Luxor; and the museum; the West Bank's lush farmland and barren cliffs are where the vast majority of Luxor's tourist attractions sit, with so many tomb and temple sights that it has been called the biggest open-air museum in the world.

      <p class="islamic">
        Egypt is defined by the Nile. For many visitors, a multi-day cruise upon this famed waterway that saw the rise of the Pharaonic era is a highlight of their Egypt trip.

        Cruising the Nile is also the most relaxing way to see the temples that stud the banks of the river on the route between Luxor and Aswan, plus sunrise and sunset over the date-palm-studded river banks, backed by sand dunes, is one of Egypt's most tranquil vistas.

        The two famous sights on a Nile Cruise are the Temple of Kom Ombo and Edfu's Temple of Horus, where all the big cruise boats stop.

        If you'd prefer a less crowded and slower experience, though, and don't mind "roughing it" a bit, you can also cruise the Nile by felucca (Egypt's traditional lateen-sailed wooden boats), which also allows you to create your own itinerary.

        The vast amount of cruise boat itineraries depart from either Luxor and Aswan, but feluccas can only be chartered for multi-day trips from Aswan.

      <p class="islamic">
        Egypt's most tranquil town is Aswan, set upon the winding curves of the Nile. Backed by orange-hued dunes, this is the perfect place to stop and unwind for a few days and soak up the chilled-out atmosphere.

        Take the river ferry across to Elephantine Island and stroll the colorful streets of the Nubian villages.

        Ride a camel to the desert monastery of St. Simeon on the East Bank. Or just drink endless cups of tea on one of the riverboat restaurants, while watching the lateen-sailed feluccas drift past.

      <p class="islamic">
        Egypt's South Sinai region, on the Sinai Peninsula, offers a beach for every type of traveler.

        Sharm el-Sheikh is a European-style resort town packed full of luxury hotels, international restaurants, and bags of entertainment options. A favorite with Europeans on winter-sun vacations, many of the resorts here cater to families on one- or two-week sun-and-sand breaks.

        Dahab is a low-key beach town with a budget-traveler heart, which is just as much about desert excursions and adventures as the sea. It's particularly known for its cheap dive-package deals and for its lagoon beach area where windsurfing and kitesurfing are the top activity.

        Up the coast, between the port town of Nuweiba and the border town of Taba, are the bamboo hut retreats that offer complete get-away-from-it-all respites from life and back-to-basics beach life.
